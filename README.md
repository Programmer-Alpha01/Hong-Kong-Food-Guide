# "Mobile Application Development : Hong Kong Food Guide"


## Introduction
Hong Kong Food Guide is an innovative mobile app designed to help travellers discover local food in Hong Kong. Using the CNN model to analyze photos, users can access detailed information about the food simply by photographing the dish.

The mobile app offers a user-friendly interface and supports seven language options: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French and Portuguese. This versatility ensures that travellers from different language backgrounds can take full advantage of the appâ€™s features.

## Current state
Currently, the app can analyze five popular Hong Kong dishes: egg tarts, siu mai, Hur Gow, milk tea and pineapple buns. This comprehensive guide is designed to give users a deeper understanding of local food culture.

The advanced version will be updated in the future.

## Notice
Please note that the analysis results provided by the application model are not 100% accurate, and the language translation may not be perfect.
